   KingForge is modded Minecraft server and modpack that I kept updated for quite a while after our favourite server and modpack - TechniCraft FORGE (short TechniFORGE) got shut down after the server machine that this modded Minecraft server was hosted on suffered from really bad hardware failure and data loss(fortunately there were regular backups). The modpack contains from 100 to 280 mods depending on the version, the most played versions were on Minecraft 1.4.10, 1.7.4 and 1.7.10. There are also 1.8 and 1.8.9 versions but these versions were released after our sponsored server was shut down and we were left without a place to host our gigantic modpack.  
The modpack is still available for download on the [ATLauncher](https://www.atlauncher.com/pack/KingForge) site.  
*Note: The most stable version seems to be Reloaded-1.4.4*
