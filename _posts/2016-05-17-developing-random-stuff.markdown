   Time for next D3Update! So as I now have a girlfriend and I am therefore almost depression free I have returned to programming and developing random stuff. For example I have created a portfolio webpage for my friend in 4 hours while she was studying for her exams... pretty rad if I say so myself! I am thinking about developing some kind of browser game and a real PC Java-based role playing game. Also a lightweight, native and fast osu! client for Linux, will have to see what does peppy have to say about that tho but I am thinking of separate "Bancho" network so there will be no issues with the scores and such. Anyway, too tired to do anything today, gonna get some sleep, gnight people!
