## Summer is comming!
And as we all know during summer there is no school to take all the free time from students.  
I will be working on various project during the summer and one or several of them include making content for my YouTube channel.  
I will be doing a vlog series which I may or may not continue after the school begins in September, these will be regular daily/every other day vlogs with updates from me about what I am working on and my plans. I expect a really great, busy and interesting summer this year so I hope I will be able to make interesting daily content for my viewers. These vlogs will be in Slovak and every week there will be one longer vlog in english summing up everything I have done the past week.  
Next thing I want to do is semi-regular YouTube series about computers, electronics and how stuff works.  
Besides these two series I want to begin streaming on Twitch  but I will have to see if there will be spare time for that.
