So... I'm now on GitHub... sort of :D I've been on GitHub for a long time but I decided to use GitHub Pages with Jekyll for my blog as my Raspberry Pi died and I like the idea of using markdown for my posts.
Everything more personal will be on my [Tumblr][d3-tumblr] (link can be also found in the footer once I finish messing around :P)
