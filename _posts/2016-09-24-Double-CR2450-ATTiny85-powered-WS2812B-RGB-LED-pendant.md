Nice... I like that title, seems too similar to the eBay listings :D

If you are following me on Twitter you could see I was tweeting about a project that I'm making since yesterday and I realized that 140 are too few characters to post updates of the project so from now on all updates will be on this blog.  
Also I'm caling it by a codename bright-spark for the sake of sanity.
