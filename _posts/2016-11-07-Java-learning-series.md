Since I'm now teaching my classmates the basics of Java and IntelliJ IDEA Community edition I will be posting videos explaining the basics, which will be an excerise for me so I don't get stuck when explaining something at the lessons, these videos will also serve as a way to revise and study ahead of the class so if you are one of my classmates welcome to my blog and I hope you will find these videos helpful and useful ðŸ˜Š
